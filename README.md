# Goose-Escape-Game

An arcade style runner game made in C++. The game contains 3 unique levels that were designed using a 2D coordinate system. The player (@) is being chased by the goose (G). They must navigate to the safe zone (%) while avoiding any walls (0). The player can also break through walls if they pick up a hammer (H) that are scattered throughout each level.

To play the game, just launch the file called "gooseEscape.exe". If you wish to view the code, that can be found in the various hpp and cpp files.


I recommend downloading the entire project as a zip, since running the game requires the dependant files (BearLibTerminal).
